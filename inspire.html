                <h2>What makes these two heroes?</h2>
                <p>During WW2 Charlie Brown was on a bombing run in a B-17F, when his bomber was severely damaged by German fighters</p>
                <p>Franz Stigler was in a perfect position to shoot Charlie Brown's bomber down, but instead he chose to escort his bomber to protect it from being shot down.</p>
                <p>This story proves that even through the horrors of war, humanity and care for other humans can come through and win the day.</p>
                <p>50 years after the war, the two pilots found each other and developed a friendship that lasted until death.</p>
