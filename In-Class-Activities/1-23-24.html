                <h1>These Japanese beef croquettes are so popular thereâ€™s a 43-year waitlist</h1>
                <h2>By Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN (Summarized by Joel LeFevre)</h2>
                <div class="titleimage"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/japanese-kobe-beef-croquettes-43-year-wait-list-intl-hnk/index.html"><img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221104125702-01-japanese-beef-croquettesv2.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_653,w_1160,c_fill/f_webp" alt="Fried Beef Croquette"></a></div>
                <p>If you order a box of frozen beef croquettes from Asahiya, they will take 43 years to complete your order. They're made of special Kobe beef, which alongside a very high demand, increases their wait time to an alarming 43 years.</p>
                <h3>An unprofitable business idea</h3>
                <p>Nitta said that they started selling their croquettes online in 1999, but people were unlikely to buy prime beef online. They were selling their croquettes at a price 66% of that which it cost to get</p>
                <p>That was only their introductory price, which got people to try their more expensive beef croquettes, which were made from special Kobe beef from people they knew.</p>
                <h3>Production boosted but popularity grows</h3>
                <p>The cheap price tag makes these croquettes seem like a much cheaper product than they are, but they're still made from quailty ingredients from a local farmer</p>
                <p>Nitta even encouraged the farmer to use the manure from the cows to grow the potatoes, and feed the cows the stems of the potatoes to create a cycle.</p>
